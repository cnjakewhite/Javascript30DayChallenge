# Javascript30DayChallenge
A new Javascript Application every day for 30 days

Welcome to my attempt to gradually increase my Javascript ability. In this ReadMe I will explain my projects on each day and try to give you an insight into why I chose them.
My solutions may not be ideal or pretty to look at but if I've done my job properly they work.

Day 1: JS Calculator --
Who doesn't need a calculator? 
My purpose with this project was to practice my onclick events and DOM manipulation. I chose a calculator as it the math behind it is simple enough and I can focus purely on
the functionality behind it. 

Day 2: JS Clock --
Does it tell time? Yes. Does it look like a clock? Somewhat.
I chose this project in particular to practice using Canvas with Javascript; I have also not found many reasons to use the Date() function in my projects and wanted to
brush up on its usage. 

Day 3: JS Dragonball --
Either revive Krillen or get better at coding... 
Day 3 was an experiment into using more design focused Canvas with Javascript. I chose a popular icon from my childhood to recreate a 3D(ish) 
component.
