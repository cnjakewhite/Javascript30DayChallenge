# JavascriptPractice

Welcome to my attempt to gradually increase my Javascript ability. In this ReadMe I will explain my projects and try to give you an insight into why I chose them.
My solutions may not be ideal or pretty to look at but if I've done my job properly they work.

JS Calculator --
Who doesn't need a calculator? 
My purpose with this project was to practice my onclick events and DOM manipulation. I chose a calculator as it the math behind it is simple enough and I can focus purely on
the functionality behind it. 

JS Clock --
Does it tell time? Yes. Does it look like a clock? Somewhat.
I chose this project in particular to practice using Canvas with Javascript; I have also not found many reasons to use the Date() function in my projects and wanted to
brush up on its usage. 

JS Dragonball --
Either revive Krillen or get better at coding... 
Day 3 was an experiment into using more design focused Canvas with Javascript. I chose a popular icon from my childhood to recreate a 3D(ish) 
component. 

JS Snakes&Ladders?
Just like that classic game you used to love as a kid, black lines and red lines! No? Just me? --
The challenge for today was to create snakes and ladders type clone that functions the same (or similar). The purpose was to create a game that depended on a state, which in this case was the dieCount that is referenced throughout the game.

The Odin Project sketch app
Like an etch-a-sketch, but more fun (for me... to build. Up to you to see if it's fun to play with)
This particular app was a crossover with The Odin Project which I am following to further my ability with full stack development, and if I'm honest I was particularly proud of my solution to this particular project. I primarily used eventHandlers to change the background colour of the cells in the grid and created a function to give the user the opportunity to create their own sized grid for more complex 'drawings'.
